  "description": "A path traversal vulnerability in KubeVirt versions up to 0.56 (and 0.55.1) on all platforms allows a user able to configure the kubevirt to read arbitrary files on the host filesystem which are publicly readable or which are readable for UID 107 or GID 107. /proc/self/<> is not accessible.,An arbitrary file read vulnerability was found in the kubeVirt API. This flaw makes it possible to use the kubeVirt API to provide access to host files (like /etc/passwd, for example) in a KubeVirt VM as a disk device that can be written to and read from.",
